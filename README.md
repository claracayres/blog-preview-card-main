# 💻 Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ccbpwqjrx) **Blog Preview Card** challenge. It's a responsive card built with semantic HTML and clean CSS, following the design as closely as possible.

- ✅ View the optimal layout for their device screen size

## 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- Custom **CSS**
- **Flexbox**
- **Google Fonts** (`Figtree`)
- Mobile-first responsive design
